    "A t-test is used when the population standard deviation is unknown or when the sample size is small. The t-test takes into account the variability of the sample and provides more accurate results when working with limited data.\n",
    "Example:A company implements a new training program to improve employee productivity. You collect data on the number of tasks completed by each employee before and after the training. Since the sample size is small and the population standard deviation is unknown, you can use a paired t-test to assess whether the training led to a significant increase in productivity.\n",
    "A z-test is used when the population standard deviation is known or when the sample size is sufficiently large (typically n≥30). The z-test assumes a normal distribution and is more appropriate when working with larger sample sizes where the central limit theorem applies.\n",
    "Example:A company claims that their new snack has a mean sodium content of 300 mg per serving. You collect a large random sample of these snacks and measure their sodium content. Since the population standard deviation is known, you can use a z-test to test if the mean sodium content of the snacks matches the claim.\n",

It reflects how much the sample estimate might deviate from the true population parameter. A larger margin of error indicates greater uncertainty, while a smaller margin of error indicates greater precision in the estimate.\n",
    "The margin of error is influenced by three main factors:\n",
    "1.Confidence Level: A higher confidence level (e.g., 95% or 99%) requires a wider interval to capture the population parameter with higher certainty, resulting in a larger margin of error.\n",
    "2.Sample Standard Deviation: A higher standard deviation in the sample data leads to greater variability and a wider interval, resulting in a larger margin of error.\n",

    "Sample Size and Margin of Error:\n",
    "Increasing the sample size generally leads to a smaller margin of error. This is because a larger sample provides more information about the population, reducing the variability in the estimate. As the sample size increases, the estimate becomes more stable and closer to the true population parameter. Consequently, the confidence interval becomes narrower, and the margin of error decreases.\n",
    "Example Scenario:\n",
    "Suppose you are conducting a survey to estimate the average income of households in a city. You have two options: one with a small sample size of 50 households and another with a larger sample size of 500 households. Let's assume that both surveys have the same confidence level of 95%.\n",

    "The variability due to the smaller sample might result in a wider confidence interval and a larger margin of error.\n",
    "For the larger sample size (500 households):\n",
    "The larger sample size provides more data points and reduces variability, leading to a narrower confidence interval and a smaller margin of error.\n",
    "In this scenario, a larger sample size (e.g., 500 households) would result in a smaller margin of error, making the estimate of the average household income more precise and reliable. This illustrates the principle that increasing the sample size generally leads to more accurate and narrower confidence intervals."
